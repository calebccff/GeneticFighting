"3bb2672","Caleb","Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:21:48 +0100","Began creating a new GUI using the G4P library and associated GUI builder, this makes it much easier to add new elements easily as I don't have to worry about the specifics of the GUI. I have also made a few more adjustments to the breeding, notably mutation now only happen to random synapses, rather than mutation randomly happening to every synapse. Changed the running boolean (the toggle between to config menu and the actual running of the simulation to a state value which would make it easier to add other states (e.g, viewing fitness/time graphs) in the future.",	 10 files changed, 205 insertions(+), 53 deletions(-)
